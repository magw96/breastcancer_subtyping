# BC Differential Expression Analysis: first + second iteration 
*VERSION 0.5:*
First iteration (using STAR) to quantify gene expression of 158 Breast Cancer cell lines, obtained through the NCBI SRA database. 

(QC, trimming and alignment performed using STAR (first iteration) and Salmon (second iteration) at: http://usegalaxy.eu

*VERSION 1.0:*
Second iteration (using Salmon) to quantify transcripts from 158 Breast Cancer cell lines, obtained through the NCBI SRA database. 

(QC, trimming and alignment performed using STAR (first iteration) and Salmon (second iteration) at: http://usegalaxy.eu

*NOTE:* DYT36T2, MCF75 missing salmon quant
